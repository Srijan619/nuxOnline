## NUX MG-30 Online Tone Editor

**Welcome to the NUX MG-30 Online Tone Editor, with this editor, you can manage your effects chain, tweak parameters, and experiment with your sound directly in the browser. It’s designed to complement the NUX MG-30’s versatile modeling capabilities, letting you arrange signal blocks, adjust settings, and explore tones—all from a clean, intuitive interface.**

*Features*

Effect Management: Easily organize and tweak your effects chain for the MG-30.
Real-Time Adjustments: Modify parameters and hear your changes (when paired with USB connectivity).
Cross-Platform: Runs in any modern browser, no extra software needed.

*Current Limitations*

Some features are still in progress:

Effects Mapping Across Scenes: Mapping effects to different scenes isn’t supported yet—stay tuned for updates!
Preset Saving: Saving presets still requires the NUX MG-30 device itself, as direct preset storage isn’t implemented here.
